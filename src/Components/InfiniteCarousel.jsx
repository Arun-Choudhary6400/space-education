  EARTH: `Earth, our home, is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. With vast oceans, lush forests, and a diverse range of ecosystems, it is often called "The Blue Planet" due to the abundance of water covering about 71% of its surface.
ðŸ”¹ Diameter: 12,742 km
ðŸ”¹ Distance from Sun: 149.6 million km
ðŸ”¹ Atmosphere: Nitrogen (78%), Oxygen (21%), Argon, COâ‚‚
ðŸ”¹ Moons: 1 (The Moon)
  `,
  JUPITER: `Jupiter is the largest planet in our Solar System, with a mass 318 times that of Earth. Its swirling atmosphere is made of hydrogen and helium, and it is home to the Great Red Spot, a storm that has raged for over 300 years.

ðŸ”¹ Diameter: 139,820 km
ðŸ”¹ Distance from Sun: 778.5 million km
ðŸ”¹ Atmosphere: Hydrogen, Helium, Methane, Ammonia
ðŸ”¹ Moons: 95+ (including Ganymede, Europa, Io, Callisto)`,
  MARS: `Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is known for its rusty red appearance due to iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It has the tallest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, and the deepest canyon, Valles Marineris. Scientists believe Mars once had liquid water, making it a key target for future human exploration.

ðŸ”¹ Diameter: 6,779 km
ðŸ”¹ Distance from Sun: 227.9 million km
ðŸ”¹ Atmosphere: Carbon dioxide (95%), Nitrogen, Argon
ðŸ”¹ Moons: 2 (Phobos, Deimos)`,
  VENUS: `Venus is often called Earth's twin because of its similar size and composition, but it has a toxic, thick atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet in our Solar System. Surface temperatures reach 475Â°C (900Â°F)â€”hot enough to melt lead!

ðŸ”¹ Diameter: 12,104 km
ðŸ”¹ Distance from Sun: 108.2 million km
ðŸ”¹ Atmosphere: Carbon dioxide (96%), Nitrogen, Sulfuric Acid Clouds
ðŸ”¹ Moons: None`
